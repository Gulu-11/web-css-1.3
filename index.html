                        This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution
                         of the universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that the history of
                          the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago.
                           As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created,
                            leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

                        Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars.
                         These are regions where gravity is so intense that nothing,
                          not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby
                           matter and can emit radiation.

                            String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description 
                            of the physical world. According to this theory, we live in a 
                            three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain
                             additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments)
                              that are part of confined spaces with different sizes and characteristics.

                        Here are three key points about String Theory:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single 
                            framework that explains all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, 
                            including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</li>
                        <li>
                            Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory 
                            proposes the existence of additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified,
                             potentially influencing the laws of physics.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks 
                            of matter are not point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that 
                            vibrate at different frequencies, with each vibration corresponding to a different
                             particle type.
